# Companion System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Companion System has been fully implemented according to the plan in `COMPANION_SYSTEM_FIX_PLAN.md`. This system enables:
- **1 Leader character** that creates games
- **1+ Companion characters** that automatically join the leader's games
- **Synchronized exits** - Companions leave when the leader leaves
- **Crash detection** - Companions detect if the leader crashes and exit gracefully

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Leader Heartbeat System ✅

**File: `internal/event/events.go`**
- Added `LeaderGameHeartbeatEvent` struct (lines 185-200)
- Contains: Leader name, game name, InGame status
- Sent every 5 seconds by the leader while in-game

**File: `internal/bot/single_supervisor.go`**
- Leader broadcasts heartbeat every 5 seconds (lines 221-251)
- Sends final exit heartbeat when leaving game (lines 229-237)
- Only active when `Companion.Enabled=true` and `Companion.Leader=true`

### 2. Companion Event Handling ✅

**File: `internal/bot/companion.go`**
- Added heartbeat tracking fields to `CompanionEventHandler`:
  - `lastLeaderHeartbeat time.Time` - Timestamp of last heartbeat
  - `leaderInGame bool` - Whether leader is currently in-game
  - `currentGameName string` - Name of the game leader is in
  - `exitGameChan chan struct{}` - Channel to signal exit
  - `mu sync.RWMutex` - Thread-safe access to fields

- Added thread-safe getter methods:
  - `GetExitGameChan()` - Returns read-only exit signal channel
  - `IsLeaderInGame()` - Checks if leader is in-game
  - `GetCurrentGameName()` - Gets current game name from heartbeat

- Implemented heartbeat event handling (lines 62-86):
  - Updates heartbeat timestamp when received
  - Tracks leader in-game status
  - Signals exit when leader sends InGame=false

### 3. Exit Coordination ✅

**File: `internal/bot/single_supervisor.go`**
- Added `companionHandler *CompanionEventHandler` field to supervisor (line 34)
- Pass companionHandler to supervisor constructor (line 45)
- Wire up companionHandler in manager.go (line 275)

**Companion Exit Monitoring (lines 253-271)**:
- Starts heartbeat timeout monitor (checks every 10 seconds)
- Listens to exit signal channel
- Cancels run context when leader exits
- Automatic exit on timeout (30 seconds without heartbeat)

### 4. Join Synchronization ✅

**File: `internal/bot/single_supervisor.go`**
- Modified `HandleCompanionMenuFlow()` (lines 500-517)
- Companion waits up to 30 seconds for leader heartbeat before joining
- Checks if leader is in-game AND game name matches
- Logs detailed status messages
- Proceeds with join even if timeout (graceful degradation)

### 5. Crash Detection ✅

**File: `internal/bot/companion.go`**
- Added `StartHeartbeatMonitor()` method (lines 119-157)
- Checks every 10 seconds for heartbeat timeout
- If 30 seconds pass without heartbeat AND leader was in-game:
  - Sets `leaderInGame = false`
  - Signals exit via `exitGameChan`
  - Logs warning about potential crash

## How It Works

### Leader Workflow

1. **Game Creation**: Leader creates a game as normal
2. **Heartbeat Broadcasting**: Every 5 seconds, leader sends `LeaderGameHeartbeatEvent` with:
   - Leader name (character name)
   - Game name
   - InGame = true
3. **Game Exit**: When leader is ready to exit:
   - Run context is cancelled (runCtx.Done)
   - Final heartbeat sent with InGame = false
   - Leader exits game

### Companion Workflow

1. **Idle State**: Companion waits with empty game name
2. **Join Request**: Leader sends `RequestCompanionJoinGameEvent`
   - Companion config updated with game name/password
3. **Wait for Leader**: Companion waits for leader heartbeat (up to 30s)
   - Checks `IsLeaderInGame()` and game name match
   - Logs "Leader confirmed in-game" when ready
4. **Join Game**: Companion joins once leader is confirmed in-game
5. **Run Tasks**: Companion executes all configured runs
6. **Wait State**: After completing all runs, companion stays in-game and waits
   - Logs: "[Companion] All runs completed, waiting for leader to exit game..."
   - Does NOT exit game automatically
   - Continues monitoring for leader exit signal
7. **In-Game Monitoring**:
   - Heartbeat monitor checks every 10 seconds
   - Exit signal monitor listens for leader exit
8. **Exit Game**: When leader exits:
   - Companion receives heartbeat with InGame=false
   - Exit signal sent via channel
   - Run context cancelled
   - Logs: "[Companion] Context cancelled, companion will now exit"
   - Companion exits game

### Crash Detection Workflow

1. **Normal Operation**: Leader sends heartbeat every 5 seconds
2. **Leader Crashes**: No more heartbeats received
3. **Timeout Detection**: After 30 seconds without heartbeat:
   - Companion logs: "Leader heartbeat timeout - leader may have crashed"
   - Sets `leaderInGame = false`
   - Signals exit
4. **Graceful Exit**: Companion exits game and waits for next game

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed! Use existing companion config:

```yaml
companion:
  enabled: true           # Enable companion mode
  leader: false           # Set to true for leader, false for companion
  leaderName: "MyLeader"  # Filter to specific leader (or "" for any leader)
  gameNameTemplate: ""    # Used by leader to create game names
  gamePassword: ""        # Used by leader for game passwords
```

## Key Behavior: Companion Wait State

**Important**: Companions will **stay in-game and wait** after completing their runs until the leader exits. This ensures synchronized exits.

### Why This Matters

- **Scenario**: Leader has 10 runs configured, Companion has 5 runs configured
- **Old Behavior**: Companion finishes 5 runs → exits game → leader still running
- **New Behavior**: Companion finishes 5 runs → **waits in-game** → leader finishes → both exit together

### Implementation Details

**File: `internal/bot/bot.go` (lines 418-427)**

After all runs complete, companions enter a wait state:

```go
// If this is a companion (not a leader), wait here until context is cancelled
// This prevents the companion from exiting the game when runs complete
if b.ctx.CharacterCfg.Companion.Enabled && !b.ctx.CharacterCfg.Companion.Leader {
    b.ctx.Logger.Info("[Companion] All runs completed, waiting for leader to exit game...")

    // Wait indefinitely until context is cancelled (by leader exit signal)
    <-ctx.Done()
    b.ctx.Logger.Info("[Companion] Context cancelled, companion will now exit")
    return nil
}
```

This blocks the low-priority run loop from returning, keeping the bot in-game until:
1. Leader exits and sends exit heartbeat (InGame=false)
2. Companion receives exit signal via channel
3. Run context is cancelled
4. Wait state unblocks and companion exits

## Files Modified

1. **`internal/event/events.go`** - Added LeaderGameHeartbeatEvent
2. **`internal/bot/companion.go`** - Added heartbeat tracking and monitoring
3. **`internal/bot/single_supervisor.go`** - Added broadcasting, monitoring, and join sync
4. **`internal/bot/manager.go`** - Wire up companionHandler to supervisor
5. **`internal/bot/bot.go`** - Added companion wait state after runs complete

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Leader + Companion
1. Configure one character as leader: `companion.enabled=true, companion.leader=true`
2. Configure another as companion: `companion.enabled=true, companion.leader=false, companion.leaderName="LeaderCharName"`
3. Start leader first
4. Start companion
5. **Expected**: Companion waits for leader, joins game, both run together

### Test 2: Leader Exit
1. Both in-game running
2. Leader finishes runs and exits game
3. **Expected**: Companion exits within 5 seconds, logs "Leader exited game, companion will exit too"

### Test 3: Crash Detection
1. Both in-game running
2. Kill the leader process (simulate crash)
3. **Expected**: After 30 seconds, companion logs timeout warning and exits

### Test 4: Multiple Companions
1. Configure 1 leader + 2-3 companions (all with same leaderName)
2. Start leader
3. Start all companions
4. **Expected**: All companions wait for leader, join game, all exit together

### Test 5: Companion Finishes Early
1. Configure leader with 10 runs, companion with 3 runs
2. Start both
3. Wait for companion to finish its 3 runs
4. **Expected**:
   - Companion logs: "[Companion] All runs completed, waiting for leader to exit game..."
   - Companion stays in-game (does not exit)
   - Leader continues running its remaining runs
   - When leader finishes and exits, companion exits too

## Logging

Look for these log messages:

**Leader**:
- `[Companion] Leader sent exit heartbeat` - Leader exiting game
- Debug logs for heartbeat every 5 seconds (if debug enabled)

**Companion**:
- `[Menu Flow]: Waiting for leader to be in-game...` - Companion waiting to join
- `[Menu Flow]: Leader confirmed in-game, joining now` - Ready to join
- `[Companion] All runs completed, waiting for leader to exit game...` - **Companion finished runs, waiting**
- `Leader exited game, companion will exit too` - Detected leader exit
- `[Companion] Companion exiting game because leader exited` - Companion exiting
- `[Companion] Context cancelled, companion will now exit` - Wait state unblocked
- `Leader heartbeat timeout - leader may have crashed` - Timeout detected

## Known Limitations

1. **Event System Dependency**: Relies on the event system working correctly
2. **Timing Sensitivity**:
   - 5-second heartbeat interval (may need tuning)
   - 30-second timeout for crash detection (may need tuning)
   - 30-second wait for leader to be in-game before join
3. **No Retry Logic**: If companion fails to join, it won't automatically retry

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** with the test scenarios above
2. **Tune timing parameters** if needed:
   - Heartbeat interval (currently 5 seconds)
   - Crash timeout (currently 30 seconds)
   - Join wait timeout (currently 30 seconds)
3. **Monitor logs** for any edge cases or issues
4. **Consider additional features**:
   - Leader broadcasts attack targets
   - Leader coordinates Town Portal requests
   - Better retry logic for failed joins

## Summary

The Companion System is now fully implemented with:
- ✅ Heartbeat broadcasting from leader
- ✅ Companion monitoring and exit coordination
- ✅ Join synchronization (wait for leader)
- ✅ Crash detection (30-second timeout)
- ✅ Thread-safe state management
- ✅ Detailed logging

The system is ready for testing! Follow the test scenarios above to verify correct operation.
